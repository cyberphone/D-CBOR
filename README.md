# D-CBOR - Deterministic Serialization for CBOR

### Abstract
_D-CBOR is a CBOR counterpart to the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) of ASN.1. D-CBOR builds on the preferred serialization options outlined in RFC8949, but with another target: secure cryptographic operations that does not require CBOR encoded data to be hashed etc. to be wrapped in a byte-string or similar in order to return a repeatable result. Although not the primary goal, by constraining serialization options, testing becomes easier, which in turn could foster interoperability._
